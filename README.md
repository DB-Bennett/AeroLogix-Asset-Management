# Aero-Logix Project: Asset Management System

This project demonstrates foundational skills in logistics, data management, and problem-solving. I developed a simple SQL database schema for an asset management system, simulating a real-world scenario for a government contractor. The project includes a complete database schema, sample data, and analytical queries to solve a simulated inventory reconciliation problem. It's a hands-on example of my ability to work with data, ensure compliance, and document my process for a professional portfolio.
